This is the game death valley from the 1982 book Computer Spacegames. Ported to Mbasic to run on my SC108/RC2014 style z80 small board computer. There are some minor tweaks to get it to run and I added a couple of tweaks for my own amusement but fundamentally the game from the book in its original form. A fair insight into gaming on a zx81 in 1982!

make sure caps lock is on. use Q and P to move you ship left and right.
the game gets quicker every hundred steps. on canyon width 16 this is still easy to beat but reduce the width for a true 1982 challenge!
